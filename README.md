# EV-Market-Fit-Growth-Index

✦ Project Overview

This project explores the Indian Electric Vehicle (EV) market, analyzing both 2-wheelers (2W) and 4-wheelers (4W). The goal is to provide insights into market dynamics, penetration trends, growth forecasts, and strategic opportunities for AtliQ Motors, which is planning to expand into India.

The entire analysis was carried out using Power BI, focusing on data modeling, DAX measures, KPI tracking, and interactive dashboarding.
